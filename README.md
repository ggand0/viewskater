# ViewSkater
ViewSkater is a fast, cross-platform image viewer written in Rust & Iced.
It aims to alleviate the challenges of exploring and comparing numerous images. Linux, macOS and Windows are currently supported.

## Features
- GPU-based image rendering powered by wgpu
- Dynamic image caching on CPU or GPU memory
- Continuous image rendering via key presses and the slider UI
- Dual pane view for side-by-side image comparison
- Supports image formats supported by the image crate (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, QOI, TGA, etc.)
- Renders images up to 8192Ã—8192 px (larger images are resized to fit)

## Installation
Download the pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/ggand0/viewskater/releases), or build it locally:

```sh
cargo run
```

To see debug logs while running, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:
```sh
RUST_LOG=viewskater=debug cargo run
```

To build a full release binary for packaging or distribution:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

See [`BUNDLING.md`](./BUNDLING.md) for full packaging instructions.


## Usage
Drag and drop an image or a directory of images onto a pane, and navigate through the images using the **A / D** keys or the slider UI.
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out of an image.

In dual-pane mode (**Ctrl + 2**), the slider syncs images in both panes by default.
You can switch to per-pane sliders by selecting the "Controls -> Controls -> Toggle Slider" menu item or pressing the **Space** bar.
